This post is all about creating responsive website from scratch. While talking about Responsive Web Design (RWD), it allows web content to expand or contract gracefully into whatever size space it is provided. Wow, that sounds pretty cool huh! There is a CSS3 attribute called “ @media screen” which makes it possible so easily. In short media queries are CSS declarations which can be called based upon the current screen dimensions of the viewing device. I find media queries to be very interesting as it’s the same kind of traditional conditional statements applied in CSS declarations.

For example see the below code:

```
@media screen and (min-width:320px) and (max-width:480px) {/*Style declarations for this width range */}
```
